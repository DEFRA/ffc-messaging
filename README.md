# ffc-messaging

Messaging npm module for FFC services

## Usage

### Installation

```
npm install --save ffc-messaging
```

### Configuration

`host` - Azure Service Bus namespace, for example, `myservicebus.servicebus.windows.net`

`useCredentialChain` - Boolean value for whether to authenticate connection with using Azure's credential chain.  For example, set this to true if you wish to use [AAD Pod Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity).  If `false`, then `username` and `password` are required.

`username` - Azure Service Bus Shared Access Key name for authentication.  Not required if `useCredentialChain` is `true`.

`password` - Azure Service Bus Shared Access Key value for authentication.  Not required if `useCredentialChain` is `true`.

`type` - Azure Service Bus entity to connect to, allows `queue`, `topic` or `subscription`.

`address` - Name of the Azure Service Bus queue, topic or subscription to connect to.

`topic` - Required for subscription connections only.  The name of the topic the subscription belongs to.

`appInsights` - Application Insights module if logging is required

#### Example

```
const config = {
  host: 'myservicebus.servicebus.windows.net',
  useCredentialChain: false,
  username: 'mySharedAccessKeyName',
  password: 'mySharedAccessKey,
  address: 'mySubscription,
  type: 'subscription',
  topic: 'myTopic',
  appInsights: require('applicationinsights')
}
```

### Sending a message

Message objects must follow the below structure.

`body` - The body of the message.

`type` - Type of message using reverse DNS notation. For example, `uk.gov.demo.claim.validated`.

`subject` - Optional, if the body alone is not sufficient to give context to the recipient.  For example, `myImage.jpeg`.

`source` - Name of the service sending the message.  For example, `ffc-demo-claim-service`

`correlationId` - Optional, if distributed tracing through Application Insights is required.


#### Example

```
const message = {
  body: { claimId: 1 },
  type: 'uk.gov.demo.claim.validated',
  subject: 'New Claim',
  source: 'ffc-demo-claim-service'
}
```
```
const sender = new MessageSender(config)
await sender.sendMessage(message)

// shutdown when needed
await sender.closeConnection()
```

The `sendMessage` function can also receive all options applicable to Azure Service Bus `sendMessages` as a parameter, see [Azure documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/service-bus).

```
await sender.sendMessage(message, options)
```

### Receiving a message

There are multiple options for receiving a message.

#### Subscribe
Permanantely subscribe to all messages.  Automatically will handle any intermittant disconnects.

```
const action = function (message) {
  console.log(message.body)
}

const receiver = new MessageReceiver(config, action)
await receiver.subscribe()

// shutdown when needed
await receiver.closeConnection()
```

#### Receive
Single call to receive current messages messages.

```
const receiver = new MessageReceiver(config, action)
// receive a maximum of 10 messages
messages = await receiver.receiveMessages(10)

// shutdown when needed
await receiver.closeConnection()
```

The `receiveMessages` function can also receive all options applicable to Azure Service Bus `receiveMessages` as a parameter, see [Azure documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/service-bus).

```
await receiver.receiveMessages(10, options)
```

It is often beneficial when using this to specify the maximum wait time for both the first message and the last message to improve performance of the application.  For example:

```
// This will wait a maximum of one second for the first message, if no message exists then the response will return.  
// If a message is received within one second it will wait a further five seconds or until it receives 10 messages to return
messages = await receiver.receiveMessages(batchSize, { maxWaitTimeInMs: 1000, maxTimeAfterFirstMessageInMs: 5000 })
```

#### Peek
Same as `receiveMessages` but does not mark the message as complete so it can still be received by other services once the peek lock expires.

```
const receiver = new MessageReceiver(config, action)
// receive a maximum of 10 messages
messages = await receiver.peekMessages(10)

// shutdown when needed
await receiver.closeConnection()
```

### Handling a received message
Once a message is received through a peek lock, a response must be sent to Azure Service Bus before the lock expires otherwise Service Bus will resend the message.

If this is not the intended behaviour there are several responses that can be sent.

#### Complete
Message is complete and no further processing needed.

```
await receiver.completeMessage(message)
```

#### Dead Letter
Message cannot be processed by any client so should be added to dead letter queue.

```
await receiver.deadLetterMessage(message)
```

### Abandon
Abandon processing of current message so it can be redelivered, potentially to another client.

```
await receiver.abandonMessage(message)
```

### Defer
Defer message back to queue for later processing.  It will not be redelivered to any client unless the receiver command supplies the sequence number as an option.

```
// Defer
await receiver.deferMessage(message)
```
